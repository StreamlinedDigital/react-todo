# react-todo

- Inside of this sharepoint-todo branch react is pulling in data from a Task list inside of a To Do List site within Office 365.
- The title, id, completed, and created columns are the specific columns being pulled in from sharepoint
- Actions within the app (adding a new todo, deleting, compleiting) do not work with the sharepoint branch (Because we cant write to the SP LIsts) but you can complete/add/change a todo in the SharePoint list and it will be reflected within the app
